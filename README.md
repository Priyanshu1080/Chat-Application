"Group Chat App" is a social media app which allows users to connect with their friends, similar to Whatsapp. The app was created using Flutter, and for the backend purposes, I used Google's Firebase. While creating this app, I realized managing the front-end and back- end together for this app was quite complex.Nevertheless, it helped me understand many concepts of app development.
